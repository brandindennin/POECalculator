# POECalculator
Developed a program to calculate the weapon damage in the computer game Path of Exile. The user would copy the weapon in the game and paste it into the application. After the file is loaded with the weaponâ€™s data, the program would utilize string manipulation to locate the correct numbers from the file and convert it from string to float. The program would then perform a calculation for the user and send the correct information to the console.

If you don't know what Path of Exile is or don't understand this code at all, use my DPS.txt file in the resource files to at least get a grasp.
It just reads from the file and grabs the Physical DPS min and Physical DPS max and performs some calculations to give you a DPS number.
